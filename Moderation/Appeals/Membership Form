In the event of any dottGRIP member getting his or her position revoked,
  an appeal can be submitted for review,
  Conditions:
    Acceptance-
      once a member is revoked of any position or permissions, said member has exactly 15 days for an appeal to be sent on their behalf,
        if no appeal is sent within those 15 days or one is sent after, the member will likely have their permissions revoked permanently.
      if said appeal is accepted, the revoked permissions will be re-gained and the user will be invited to rejoin the team.
    Declination-
      in order for an appeal to be denied, it must first be reviewed by at least 1 administrator,
        the admin(s) who do so will be required to give a valid and reasonable explanation as to why the appeal has been denied.
      if an appeal has been submitted for a former-member who had their permissions revoked with a severity level higher than 2,
        the appeal will automatically be declined and will recieve no further attention.
    Applicable members-
      any member of the dottGRIP Team will have the ability to submit an appeal.
